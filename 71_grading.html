        we have a list of students in a class. Every student is graded <br>
        on a scale of 0 to 100. Any student below 40 marks is given a grade of fail. <br>
        For students whose marks are less than 3 to a multiple of five, their marks <br>
        are rounded up to the multiple of 5.
