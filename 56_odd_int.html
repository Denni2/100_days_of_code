        as th title goes, you are to find the odd integer <br>
        but this cumulatively from a set of integers within an <br>
        array. You are supposed to find the integer that is repeated <br>
        an odd number of times. It is only one <br>
        <hr>
        eg. [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4] <br>
        should return 3 as the odd integer since it appears three times in the array

        happy coding!!
